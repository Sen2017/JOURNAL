            <p>
              UX is defined as User Experience. It includes user satisfaction and hassle-free service.
            </p>
            <p>

            <h3><i>HTML vs CSS</i></h3>
            <p>
              What I like about HTML and CSS is that they both look really nice in Sublime Text. I do not however like how it looks when displayed in a browser. It's super cringe-worthy.

              Recreating this webpage is heavily based on organizational skills and intepretation of elements. Beyond that, knowledge of CSS is heavily involved in making CHEESE.

              <h3><i>Responsive Design</i></h3>
              <p>
                Responsive design is really great for applications and web designs because it allows content to be viewed cross platform. This type of functionality allows content to be delivered to more people. It utilizes ephemeral units (em) to size content relative to parent elements.

                Javascript is basically.... hard. Nah I think js is pretty sweet and I'm really excited in what I can create on my own. I'm planning on getting computercraft and stuff for minecraft to experiment with the functional side of programming.

              <h3><i>V.A.C. Review</i></h3>
              <p>
                Our school's counseling office is not the most space friendly and when it comes to servicing large volumes of students, the counseling offices become flooded with students with barely enough room to shuffle by. This can cut a lot of students off from the support they need to help them get through their years at highschool.
                BetterComm is a mobile app that aims to improve the connection between counseling staff and students in a school environment.
                I'd improve our video by focussing more on features than purpose. It would greatly improve our video to have a rundown of all the features and a graphical concept of what those features would look like on the mobile platform.
                Bettercomm is currently slated to have the following features: appointment making, counselor chat rooms with the ability to remain annonymous, and push notifications that can remind students of their appointments. Counselors could also make their own announcement and have Bettercomm send them to the student(s) via a push notification.
                I'd like to add desktop compatibility for counselors to be able to work in an environment more familiar to them. 
                A challenge my team and I faced was to find time to meet together. I wasn't available till after 3:30 and most of my teamates need to leave campus by 300.
                No offense to my great team members, but next time, I'd like to create content with people I know and have worked with in the past. I feel this would greatly increase productivity and since we travel in the same circles, we're likely to be available at the same times.
